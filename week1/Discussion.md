Hello, 

My name is Peter Tumulty and the reason why I chose Computer Science is because 10 yerars ago I wrote my first line of JavaScript code and ever since then I've been hooked. I am currently a working front-end developer who has a desire to continually develop my understanding of computers. Therefore, I am currently earning my degree in Computer Science at SNHU. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanics of how these machines work. I want to learn how to write advanced C++ and Java code and get into distributed systems and expand my knowledge of web development.

My comfort level with C++ I think would be at the tail end of beginnering, dabbling in intermediate development. I've taken CS courses in the past that worked with C++ and I've completed a LinkedIn Learning course on it as well.I have a lot of experience using PHP, Python, and JavaScript mainly because I work with them at work. I would say I am most advanced at JavaScript because I've taught coding bootcamps that were heavily specialized in JS. I currently write Typescript at work and I would say Typescript would be nearly impossible to write if you don't have a pretty advanced knowledge of JavaScript.
